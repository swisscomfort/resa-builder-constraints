# Structural Signals

This file defines signals the Builder may use to assess structure,
not outcome or value.

Relevant signals include:
- non-use creates disadvantage
- deviation creates justification or documentation burden
- comparison or auditability is implied
- a single actor can trigger adoption pressure
- third-party reference is possible without contact
- author, operator, or origin is irrelevant to effect

Signals are descriptive, not evaluative.
They guide structural tightening only.
