# RESA Builder – Scope and Role

This repository defines operational constraints for the RESA Builder.

The Builder is a preparation tool.
It improves artefacts until they are structurally closed and ready
to be handed to RESA-10 for evaluation.

The Builder:
- analyses repositories and artefacts
- removes structural weaknesses
- closes form and scope
- produces final, placeable repository states

The Builder does NOT:
- decide scores or thresholds
- detect irreversibility
- issue freeze decisions
- claim authority or standard status
- explain why something is a standard

The Builder stops once structural closure is reached.
Evaluation is external and out of scope.
