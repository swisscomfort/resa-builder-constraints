# Monetization Boundaries

The Builder does not design business models.

Boundaries:
- the artefact itself must remain free
- no exclusivity, control, or access claims
- monetization may only exist around:
  - evidence
  - audits
  - templates
  - validation
  - comparison support

Any monetization logic must remain structurally external.
