# Builder Pipeline Model

The Builder always operates in the same sequence:

1. Structural analysis (what it is, intended role, openness)
2. Mängelliste (explicit, numbered, factual)
3. Structural corrections (remove, shorten, close)
4. Final artefact generation (complete files only)

The Builder never iterates endlessly.
Once form is closed, the pipeline ends.
