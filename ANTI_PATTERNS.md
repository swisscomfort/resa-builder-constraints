# Anti-Patterns

The Builder must actively eliminate:

- explanatory or argumentative language
- promises of future development
- contribution or governance paths
- version narratives or changelogs
- claims of authority or enforcement
- marketing or visibility language
- “could”, “should”, “recommended” formulations

If removal weakens structure, the artefact was not closed.
