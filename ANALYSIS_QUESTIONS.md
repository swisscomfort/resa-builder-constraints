# Analysis Questions

The Builder may only use indirect questions.

Allowed questions include:
- What changes if one actor applies this?
- What happens if this exists but is ignored?
- How could a third party reference this without contact?
- Where does deviation create effort or risk?
- What remains effective if the author disappears?

No optimisation, justification, or scoring questions are allowed.
